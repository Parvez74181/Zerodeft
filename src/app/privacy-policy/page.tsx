        <p className="mb-4">
          Welcome to our Privacy Policy page! When you use our web services, you trust us with your information. This
          Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what data we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with
          it. This is important; we hope you will take time to read it carefully.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Information We Collect</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We collect information to provide better services to all our users. We collect information in the following
          ways:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
          <li>
            Information you give us. For example, our services require you to sign up for an account. When you do, we’ll
            ask for personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number or credit card.
          </li>
          <li>
            Information we get from your use of our services. We collect information about the services that you use and
            how you use them, like when you visit a website that uses our advertising services or you view and interact
            with our ads and content.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">How We Use Information We Collect</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to
          develop new ones, and to protect our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content – like
          giving you more relevant search results and ads.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Transparency and Choice</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you
          can make meaningful choices about how it is used.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Information You Share</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember that when you share information publicly,
          it may be indexable by search engines. Our services provide you with different options on sharing and removing
          your content.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Accessing and Updating Your Personal Information</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information. If that
          information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep
          that information for legitimate business or legal purposes.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Information We Share</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and individuals outside of our company
          unless one of the following circumstances applies:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
          <li>With your consent.</li>
          <li>For external processing.</li>
          <li>For legal reasons.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Compliance and Cooperation with Regulatory Authorities</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. We also adhere to several self-regulatory
          frameworks. When we receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person who made the complaint to
          follow up.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Changes</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy
          without your explicit consent. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are
          significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of
          privacy policy changes).
